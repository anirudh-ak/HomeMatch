# HomeMatch Project

This project, **HomeMatch**, is designed to demonstrate the use of a Large Language Model (LLM) for generating synthetic real estate listings, implementing semantic search, and personalizing property descriptions based on buyer preferences. Below is an overview of the project's structure and key components.

## Overview

The **HomeMatch** project uses a Large Language Model to generate synthetic real estate listings, and then implements a semantic search engine that allows users to search for properties based on their specific preferences. The project is designed to personalize property descriptions to better align with what the buyer is looking for, without altering factual information.

## Installation

To run this project, you will need to install the necessary Python libraries. The required libraries can be found in the `requirements.txt` file in this workspace.

To install the dependencies, use the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Ensure that your environment is set up with the necessary API keys and configurations to access OpenAI services.

## Project Structure

### 1. Synthetic Data Generation

**Objective:** Generate synthetic real estate listings using an LLM.

**Approach:**
- The project starts by importing the required libraries and setting up the environment.
- It then uses a pre-trained language model to create synthetic listings that simulate real-world data.

### 2. Implementing Semantic Search

**Objective:** Enable semantic search of listings based on structured buyer preferences.

**Vector Database Setup:**
- The project initializes and configures ChromaDB (or a similar vector database) to store the generated real estate listings.

**Embedding Generation:**
- The LLM-generated listings are transformed into embeddings that represent the semantic content of each listing.
- These embeddings are stored in the vector database for efficient search.

### 3. Generating Augmented Responses

**Objective:** Personalize listing descriptions to resonate with buyer preferences.

**LLM Enhancement:**
- For each retrieved listing, the LLM is used to refine the description, tailoring it to align with the buyerâ€™s specific preferences by emphasizing relevant features of the property.

**Factual Integrity:**
- The augmentation process enhances the appeal of the listing while ensuring factual accuracy is maintained.

## Usage

To use the project, follow these steps:

1. Ensure the necessary environment variables, including the OpenAI API key, are set.
2. Run the notebook in a Python environment with access to the required dependencies.
3. Follow the steps outlined in the notebook to generate data, perform semantic search, and create personalized listing descriptions.
